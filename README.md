# Selection-Indexes
This script uses code made available from:

Lopez-Cruz, M., Olson, E., Rovere, G. et al. Regularized selection indices for breeding value prediction using hyper-spectral image data. Sci Rep 10, 8195 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-65011-2

I used for a set of phenotypic traits. In this script they compared standard selection indexes (SI), Reduced-rank selection index (PC_SI) and Penalized selection indices (L1PSI)
